#Z3 Timetable

This timetable scheduler was built originally by Tan Kai Min, Russell and then additionally modified by Tan Li Thai Sean.
It uses the Z3 SMT Solver built by Microsoft Research.
We used an SMT Solver because timetable scheduling could be seen as a constraint satisfaction task which a SMT solver can help.
